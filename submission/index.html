<h3>Submission Server</h3>

<p>We will be using EasyChair for managing paper submissions and reviews.</p>

<p>EasyChair URL for LCTES 2015: <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lctes2015">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=lctes2015</a></p>

&nbsp;<br/>

<h3>Formatting Guidelines</h3>

<p>?Submissions must be in ACM proceedings format, 9-point type, and may not exceed 10 pages (all inclusive). Word and LaTeX templates for this format are available on the <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Author/">ACM website</a>. Submissions must be in PDF, printable on US Letter and A4 sized paper. To enable double-blind reviewing, submissions must adhere to two rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>author names and their affiliations must be omitted; and,</li>
<li>references to related work by the authors should be in the third person (e.g., not "We build on our previous work ..." but rather "We build on the work of ...").</li>
</ul>
<p>However, nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult (e.g., important background references should not be omitted or anonymized). Papers must describe unpublished work that is not currently submitted for publication elsewhere as discussed here. Authors of accepted papers will be required to sign an ACM copyright release.</p>
